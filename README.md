# dog-api-app1

This was a fun introduction to working with APIs.

The app grabs data from the internet's biggest collection of open source dog pictures (dog.ceo).

Question 1 allows the user to choose a number of random dog images to get from the API. The API response is logged to the console.

Question 2 is similar to question 1 but actually displays the pictures referenced in the API response.

Question 3 allows the user to choose a specific breed of dog for which to display a single image. If the user chooses a breed that is not available from dog.ceo, an alert message is displayed.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
